  twist on DLO:\@ omega shape, s shape, u shape, circle shape, ellipse shape,
  spiral.
- Clamped end low, DLO on table and 3D, with twist: same shapes.
- Clamped end low, DLO angles at 30 degrees and 3D, without twist.
- Clamped end low, DLO angles at 45 degrees and 3D, without wist.
- Clamped end low, DLO angles at 60 degrees and 3D, without twist.
- Clamped end low, DLO angles at 75 degrees and 3D, without twist.
- Clamped end low, DLO angles at 90 degrees and 3D, without twist.
